Join thousands of happy customers and start driving engagement with Omnisend today. Here‚Äôs what our customers are saying about us:

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
> ‚ÄúVery great functionality that makes my WooCommerce business grow rapidly. The support is outstanding, and they always do their best to solve everything I need.‚Äù

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
> ‚ÄúOmnisend is excellent for a very beginner. It's so easy to use but if you do not understand something, customer service is always ready to help. There is a chat icon on every page, and they answer just some minutes after the question. I feel very encouraged even if is my very first experience with such a service.‚Äù

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
> ‚ÄúI manage multiple stores with different providers, mostly were mailchimp, well after trying omnisend (especially with big data stores) I decided to switch multiple big stores (over 100k orders); the decision was easy to make as the sync process on mailchimp, it took a week! Here it took 3 hours! That is just the biggest leap for me as mailchimp would randomly disconnect the store or cancel automations without notice (multiple accounts). Using omnisend on almost 10 stores for 4 months and everything is great! The interface, automations and support are very good, I strongly recommend them for stores who need data statistics and segmentation (grouping) on their audience (lists), who need fast automations, great, reliable and fast support. P.S. Their API has responses and it‚Äôs pretty well documented, I‚Äôve made a few implementations and everything looks great!‚Äù

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
> ‚ÄúWe have been using Omnisend for some time now and their interface is easy and intuitive and integrating with our other systems and apps has been seamless. If ever we have a question they are quick to answer and are always helpful. A big shout out to both Agustine and Stefan they are a credit to your team üôÇ‚Äù
